2,ElectricAndGas,Electric/Gas Meters,"Electric Panels and Gas Meters can be found in various locations, both outside and inside residential premises. While they are commonly positioned outside, as demonstrated here, they can also be situated inside the household, particularly in basements or subdwellings. It's important to note that the specific location may vary depending on the region, with colder climates often having these panels placed indoors for protection against the elements.",/Script/Engine.Texture2D'/Game/Art/Textures/Icons/Practice/1055110_bolt_electricity_icon.1055110_bolt_electricity_icon',Enabled,None,None,None
3,EVFire,Electric Vehicle,"Fires involving lithium batteries in Electric Vehicles can have distinct characteristics compared to typical house fires. One significant concern is the potential for thermal runaway, wherein an overheated lithium-ion cell can ignite, leading to the release of flammable gases. This thermal instability can initiate a chain reaction among other cells, occurring within a timeframe ranging from milliseconds to hours, depending on the speed of cell failure. The exothermic heat generated during this process can be adequate to ignite a fire.

Several factors can trigger lithium battery fires, including:

Short circuits: Circuits may short due to improper storage, damage, or the presence of metal dust, ultimately leading to combustion.

Overheating: Extreme temperatures in loading docks, cargo holds, or tarmacs during transportation or storage can cause batteries to overheat or catch fire.

Rough handling: Excessive jostling or dropping of batteries during transport or use can trigger thermal runaway.

Physical damage: Shredding or dismantling batteries during recycling operations can result in explosions.

Wet/humid conditions: Rainwater, salty air, or high humidity levels can induce short circuits and initiate thermal runaway, even without prior battery damage.

Given these risks, it is crucial to adopt specialized measures and precautions when dealing with Electric Vehicle fires to ensure effective and safe extinguishing.",None,Enabled,/Script/MediaAssets.MediaPlayer'/Game/Art/Video_Clips/MediaPlayers/Players/EVFireVidMPlayer.EVFireVidMPlayer',/Script/MediaAssets.FileMediaSource'/Game/Art/Video_Clips/MediaPlayers/Sources/EVFire.EVFire',/Script/MediaAssets.MediaTexture'/Game/Art/Video_Clips/MediaPlayers/Textures/EVFireVidMediaTexture.EVFireVidMediaTexture'
